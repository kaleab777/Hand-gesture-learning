## Hand Landmarks
A hand landmark is a key point on the hand like the wrist or fingertip.
The model gives 21 landmarks and each one has x, y, z coordinates.

## Why Landmarks Are Better Than Pixels
Pixels change with lighting and background.
Landmarks describe the shape and position of the hand, which is more stable.

## What Makes a Good Feature
A good feature is a number that represents the gesture clearly.
Distances and angles between fingers are good features.
